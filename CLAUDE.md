Guidance for working on lightning — a code generator that emits fast,
allocation-light `json.Unmarshaler` implementations.

## Layout

- `main.go` — the generator (`package main`). Reads struct defs, emits
  `*_unmarshal.go`. Key bits: `field`/`sliceDecoder`/`mapDecoder` build decoders;
  `slicePresize` decides presizing; `g.compact`/`g.skipWS` handle the
  `//lightning:compact` directive (compile-time elision of inter-token `SkipWS`).
- `pkg/support` — the runtime scanning primitives every generated decoder calls.
  This is where almost all performance work happens.
- `pkg/json` — small public API over the scanner (`Get`/`GetMany`/`ObjectEach`
  + `*Compact`, `Unwrap`, `UnescapeString`, `ParseFloat`).
- `bench/` — separate module (keeps easyjson/sonic deps out of the main module).
  `run_bench.sh` regenerates decoders and benchmarks lightning vs
  encoding/json, easyjson, and bytedance/sonic. `bench/large-json/input.json` is
  the ~8 MB GeoJSON, gitignored and downloaded from `input.url`.

## Benchmarking — read this before claiming any speedup

**`run_bench.sh` runs each benchmark ONCE; those numbers are noisy** (first-run
GC/cache effects can make the faster decoder look slower — sonic "beat" lightning
on large-json in a single run while being ~17% slower over repeated runs). The
machine also drifts ~5–8% over minutes.

**Always measure with interleaved A/B**: `go test -c` a binary for each variant
(base via `git stash`, opt from the tree), alternate running them, feed both to
`~/go/bin/benchstat`. Build inside `bench/`; run each from its data dir (it reads
`input.json` relative to CWD). Treat <~2% as noise. For lightning-vs-competitor,
run `-count=8+` and compare medians, not the single run.

Hot functions are sensitive to **linker/code-alignment**: adding code (e.g. a
lookup table) can shift a tight micro-benchmark like `float-array` a few % with no
change to its executed instructions. Keep hot paths (`scanFloat`'s Clinger loop)
byte-identical when adding cold paths; push new logic out-of-line.

## Performance architecture (the load-bearing designs)

- **Float parsing** tiers in `scanFloat`: Clinger (exact mantissa <2^53, |exp|≤22,
  one mul/div) → **Eisel-Lemire** (`eiselLemire64` + generated `powers_table.go`,
  for mantissa ≥2^53 or |exp|>22) → `strconv`. EL is inline in `scanFloat` (no
  rescan) and bit-identical to strconv when it returns ok; guarded by the
  differential fuzz `TestParseFloatMatchesStrconv`. Don't remove EL.
- **`CountArrayElements`** (slice presize) skips each element with `SkipValue`
  (vectorized via `indexStructural`), not a byte-by-byte depth walk.
- **`slicePresize`** skips presize when a struct element transitively holds a
  *multi-dimensional* slice (`hasMultiDimSlice`, e.g. GeoJSON `[][][]float64`):
  counting it would deep-scan every element's bulk for only ~log2(n) reallocs
  saved. Flat / string / 1-D-slice records (Cloudflare-style) keep presize and
  their low B/op.
- **SIMD scanners** in `index_amd64.s`/`index_arm64.s`: `indexCloseOrEscape`
  (next `"`/`\`, SSE2 — no VZEROUPPER), `indexStructural` (next `{}[]"`, AVX2).
- **Date parsing**: `daysFromCivilCached` uses a year-start-days table (built from
  `daysFromCivil`) for 1970–2261; falls back to the general algorithm otherwise.

## The inline trick — let the generator write hot bodies inline

Go's inliner refuses `SkipWS`, `ReadKey`, and `indexCloseOrEscape` (each exceeds
the cost budget once it holds a SIMD/asm call), so calling them from generated
code pays full call overhead per token. Instead the **generator writes the hot
fast path inline at the call site** and falls back to a support call only for the
rare/hard case. See `g.skipWS` and `g.readKey` in `main.go`:

- **skipWS** emits the whitespace check inline:
  `if i < len(data) && data[i] <= ' ' { i++; if i < len(data) && data[i] <= ' ' { i = support.SkipWSRun(data, i+1) } }`.
  The common 0–1 whitespace bytes cost one or two compares and no call; only a run
  of ≥2 (pretty-print indentation) reaches the SWAR `SkipWSRun`.
- **readKey** emits the no-escape key read inline — a `support.IndexCloseOrEscape`
  scan plus a `support.UnsafeStr` alias — falling back to `support.ReadKey` only
  for an escaped key or an error. It relies on tiny inlinable exported wrappers
  `IndexCloseOrEscape`/`UnsafeStr` that themselves inline, so the generated code
  reaches the SIMD scanner with no wrapper call. Won ~6–7% on the cloudflare
  family, no regressions.

Why it beats making the support funcs inlinable: the cheap common case skips the
call entirely, and the shared scanner keeps its tuned dispatch.

**Scope it to once-per-loop reads.** `skipWS`/`readKey` fire once per object member,
so the inline block stays small. Inlining a *per-field* read (e.g. string values)
emits the block once per struct field, which bloats a wide struct's decoder
(`string_unicode` has 60 string fields): the function grows past the inliner's
per-function budget, `IndexCloseOrEscape` stops inlining, and i-cache pressure
turned a −8% cloudflare win into a +9% regression there. Don't inline per-field
reads.

## Tried and rejected (don't re-attempt without a new idea)

- **SWAR 8-digit float parsing**: net-negative. Helped only synthetic
  `float-array-slow` (−18%); regressed common `float-array` (+4–9%, the per-number
  `is8Digits` check); flat on real `large-json` coordinates.
- **Vectorizing `SkipWS` as a standalone function**: regresses — the SWAR/SIMD
  setup isn't amortized on the common 0–1 byte runs. It pays off *only* via the
  inline trick above (inline fast path for short runs; `SkipWSRun` SWAR for ≥2-byte
  runs). Done — not rejected — once moved to the call site.
- **Pure-SSE2 `indexStructural`** (dropping AVX2): ~2× slower on the skip path
  (`skip-heavy`); the throughput loss dwarfs the VZEROUPPER saving.

## Conventions

- Bench `data.go` files use a single top-level `Benchmark` with **anonymous**
  nested structs, so only `Benchmark` gets a generated method and
  `type benchmarkStd Benchmark` gives a clean reflection-only baseline for the
  stdlib/sonic benchmarks.
- End-of-session: run the full suite (`go test ./...`), keep gofmt clean
  (the `daysFromCivil` comment-alignment flag is pre-existing — ignore it),
  and regenerate `bench/results_<goarch>.md` via `run_bench.sh`.
